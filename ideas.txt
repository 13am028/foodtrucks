Best way for tying map markers and listings together:
0. Create and instantiate a map view
1. Add markers one by one.
2. For each marker
    - create a new model using marker.feature
    - add a new property - pos on the model as well
    - store the marker as the model's property and in an array
3. Create a view and add it to the listing
4. On clicking the view, the model.marker.openPopup is called.
    - Or one could just get the pos (id) and call Array.markers[i].openPopup()
5. When a marker is clicked
    - Get this marker's index in the marker array
    - Filter the collection on basis of this index and model.pos
